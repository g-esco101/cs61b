# [UC Berkeley's CS 61B Data Structures, Spring 2019](https://sp19.datastructur.es/index.html)

For review and practice. 

Test Driven Development used to complete the labs, projects, and homeworks. 

The README files in the projects and homeworks contain a list of the files I created or updated, as well as other modifications that I made that are not in the instructions, such as dependency injection and exceptions. 

## Tools
- java 11
- junit5
- javadoc
- Intellij IDEA
- [cs61b plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9423-cs-61b) (a code style checker)
- [java visualizer plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/11512-java-visualizer) (a tool to visualize the call stack and objects on the heap)
- [library-sp19](https://github.com/Berkeley-CS61B/library-sp19/tree/7fe87114b62fdcf0a6af3ec3d9e96b0ef4f64523) (a library used for this course) Note: I use Junit5 instead of Junit4, which is provided in this library.
