# [Lab 2: Unit Testing with JUnit and IntLists](https://sp19.datastructur.es/materials/lab/lab2/lab2)

Concerns debugging, destructive methods, non-destructive methods, IntLists, and pointers, as well as writing IntList methods destructively, non-destructively, recursively, and iteratively.

## Run
Open in intellij IDEA & run the TestIntList.java file.


## Files modified or created
Implemented the following methods in [IntList.java](Intlist/IntList.java):
- dcatenate
- dcatenateIterative
- catenate
- catenateIterative

Found and fixed bugs in the DebugPractice directory, including re-writing the max method in [DebugExercise2.java](DebugPractice/DebugExercise2.java)
